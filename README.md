# SJSU U29 Wildfire Analysis Through Lightning Data Frontend

## Setting up

### Basic setup (required)

#### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**
2. **NPM**

First, clone the `wildfire-frontend` repo

After cloning, you will need the `.env` file which contains the required environment variables for the development environment. Because this file stores secret API tokens, it is distributed privately to preventing storing secrets on Github. Place this file in the **root** directory of the repo you just cloned. **Please Ask a developer for these environment variables**

Install NPM dependencies:

    $ npm install

Finally, start it all up:

    $ npm start
